# The Pod Review

The Pod Review is a single page application that allows users with
an account to add their favorite podcast with a rating. This application also
allows signed in users to see all of the podcast submissions that have been made.

I am an avid podcast listener and podcaster and that was my inspiration for this
project. I've always thought it would be cool to have a forum dedicated to sharing
opinions and recent listens.

## Planning & Development

I started this project by planning out the user stories and making wireframes
to get an idea of how I wanted it to look and possible capabilities. I then focused
on API and set up the routes for the API requests. I tested each route using
cURL program and made sure they worked before moving onto the front-end. I started
the front end by adding the client side authentication, and making sure it worked.
I then moved adding the ability to create, update and delete resources on the client
side. I also did minimal styling. Debugged and refactored my code.

## Unsolved Problems and Future Goals

I would for the page to reload as soon as the user updates their ratings.
I would also like to add a comment sections where users can leave comments on each
others posts. I would like to eventually make this a forum style app that allows
communication between users. I want to add more styling and make my code more DRY.
